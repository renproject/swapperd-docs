# Introduction

*SwapperD* is a daemon service that can execute cross-chain atomic swaps between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC20 tokens, with more blockchain support coming soon. There are two ways to interact with *SwapperD*: either directly with the *SwapperD* daemon; or through the [*SwapperD Desktop*](https://github.com/renproject/swapperd-desktop) application.

*SwapperD* is a standalone daemon service but the *SwapperD Desktop* application relies on *SwapperD* under the hood. When installing *SwapperD Desktop* the *SwapperD* daemon will be installed as well.
